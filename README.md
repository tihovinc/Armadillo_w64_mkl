# Armadillo_w64_mkl
This project is reminder for compiling Armadillo C++ Linear Algebra Library in Windows and linking it with Intel MKL.

### Armadillo

Armadillo is a high quality C++ linear algebra library, 
aiming towards a good balance between speed and ease of use. 
It's useful for algorithm development directly in C++, 
and/or quick conversion of research code into production environments. 
The syntax (API) is deliberately similar to Matlab.

The library provides efficient classes for vectors, matrices and cubes, 
as well as 200+ associated functions (eg. contiguous and non-contiguous 
submatrix views).  Various matrix decompositions are provided through 
integration with LAPACK, or one of its high performance drop-in replacements 
(eg. OpenBLAS, Intel MKL, AMD ACML, Apple Accelerate framework, etc).

A sophisticated expression evaluator (via C++ template meta-programming) 
automatically combines several operations (at compile time) to increase speed 
and efficiency.

The library can be used for machine learning, pattern recognition, computer vision, 
signal processing, bioinformatics, statistics, econometrics, etc.

Armadillo is primarily developed at Data61 / NICTA (Australia).
